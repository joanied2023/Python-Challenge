# Python-Challenge
This holds Module 3 Python Challenge homework for PyBank and PyPoll
PLease note that I could not get some things to work yet. In PyBank - haven't figured out how to find the months of greatest gains and losses (only the number portion of that question.)  In PyPoll, i didn't have enough time to figure out the Percent of votes each candidate got.  ALso couldn't figure out how to print the dictionary contents to a text file.  Simply ran out of time.
